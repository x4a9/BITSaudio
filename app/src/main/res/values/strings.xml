    <string name="instructions">This app can evaluate your hearing capabilities.\nFirst your earphones must be calibrated. \n\nImportant: Earphones must not have integrated volume control or loudness, equalizers, etc! \n\nYou can either perform a full test which requires one or better several persons between the ages of 18 and 35 with normal hearing. Or you can perform a simple calibration at 1000Hz only (assuming good hearing at this frequency). In this case it is assumed that the earphones are linear across the frequency range and calibration values for the other frequencies are then calculated using the ISO226:2003 standard.\n\nWhenever you hear a beep simply touch the screen. You can pause / continue with a long click and speed up with a double click.\n\nIf you have several persons available for calibration simply press "Add Calibration" and an average value of existing calibrations will be calculated. You may also delete the whole calibration.\n\nAfter that you can perform tests and view them in test results.\n\nYou can then also perform tests at single frequencies. There you can manually select ear, frequency, and sound amplitude by clicking on the buttons.</string>
